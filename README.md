A simple project using a Docker environment to simulate microservices being consumed by a GraphQL server. The project operates as follows:<br> An API provides a list of basketball teams, another API provides a list of all players. Using our third API with [Apollo Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), we obtain the team based on the search from our frontend and transparently retrieve and insert the players who play for that team into the query result for our frontend.<br>
The project runs within containers using Docker and Docker Compose. The containers include apiTeams[node], apiPlayers[node], server[apolloserver - node], and frontend[nginx with reverse proxy to the server].
